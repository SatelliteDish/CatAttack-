  <h1>Welcome to my first game: <br> <em>Cat Attack!<em> </h1>

<div id="intro" align="left">
  <p>Cat Attack is an infinite runner game for android that is currently not on the Play Store. You play as a cat, and your main goal is to destroy the property of your owners. The more valuable and irreplaceable the item, the more points you get. The game is not in release condition and still has bugs that need to be worked out. Cat Attack has and will always be free to play, with all ads being both opt in and rewarded. My goal with the game is to create an infinite runner that brings some new ideas and mechanics to the genre, as I feel it could use some diversity.</p>

  <h3><em>Development</em></h3>
  <p>Cat Attack is developed by myself and currently only myself. I'm open to help however, so feel free to get in touch if you'd like to help! This is my first solo project, and I started it very early on in my dev career. That being said, a lot of the code and underlying systems need to be refactored heavily, which I am undertaking now. If you have any ideas for features please open an issue and it will be looked into! Please don't open an issue for bugs at the moment, I'm aware of the existence of a lot of them and am working on them. Currently, this Repo won't compile. This is because my code was so poorly abstracted that in order to refactor my main player script I also have to refactor multiple main systems. I'm aware this is due to not following best practices or design patters, but that's what happens when you start a project while as inexperienced as I was.  </p>

    <h3><em>Art</em></h3>
    <p><em>All</em> the art and animations in Cat Attack were done by me by hand. I learned pixel art for this project, so some assets (mostly the player and furniture) are among the first pieces I've ever done. Because of that, I do want to change out a lot of the assets over time, as well as clean up the ones that already exist. Most of the sound effects where made by me, those that aren't are just placeholders and will be changed by release. The music however, was commissioned from ZaneLittleMusic on Fiverr. I think he did an incredible job, and he was very nice to work with so please check him out if you enjoy his work.</p>
